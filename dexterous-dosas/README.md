## Overview - *Combining Opposites*

Chess is a logical & strategic game which is perceived as very boring by the masses. And on the other hand music is enjoyed by almost every human living on this planet. Our team - Dexterious Dosas - have tried to combine these two boring and fun things and have come up with this website where all your matches can be turned into a different musical tune based on the moves you and your oppoenent have played. You'll find tunes in both major and minor scales and spread out over all the musical notes with different rhytms. 

## Future Expansion

* Using the Stockfish chess engine to reflect the quality of moves in the tunes 
* Introducing more instruments and layers 
* Training an ML Model to compose tunes based on a specific chess position
* A lot of professional level chess players remember tonnes of matches move by move. These short musical themes might help novice players get better.

## Ending Note

Chess is an amazing game and we love it, and we really hope people would get into chess because of this website.
Keep playing chess, and keep grooving to fun tunes!
